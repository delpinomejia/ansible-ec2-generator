# README #

Spin up a new instance quickly and effortlessly, for research and testing purposes.

### How do I get set up? ###

* Install Ansible from https://www.ansible.com/
* Clone this repo locally
* Change variables to your liking
* Profit!

### Who do I talk to? ###

* Repo owner is available on Linkedin (https://www.linkedin.com/in/pdelpino/). Gifts, compliments and/or chocolates can be delivered and will be welcome.

### Notes

* The provided `vars_sample.yml` needs to be renamed to `vars.yml`in order for the Playbook to be functional. Current values are simply placeholders.
* Resources like VPC, Subnets, SSH keys and Security Group need to be ideally created beforehand, and their values incorporated into the `vars.yml` file.
